LIF_TrueNorth
=============
The LIFneuronBasic.m file contains the basic LIF neuron model, with the configurability and stochasticity options highlighted in the paper:

A. S. Cassidy et al., “Cognitive computing building block: A versatile and efﬁcient digital neuron model for neurosynaptic cores,” in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN). IEEE, 2013.

The basic neuron model of LIFneuronBasic.m is extended into a network model by replacing the user inputs by inputs from the axons of other neurons.
